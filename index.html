    <h3>If Something Can Be Slowed Down Does It Have An Speed ? </h3>
<p>Time Dilation Is A Topic Not Mentioned Often, But It Shows That Time Can Be Slowed Down.</p>
<p>This Diagram Below Shows The Gravitational Pull Of An Blackhole And Other Heavenly Bodies: </p>

    <p><em>Figure 3: An Artistic Representation Of An Blackhole.</em></p>
<p>As We Can See, A Black Hole Has Such A Strong Gravitational Pull That Even Light Bends Around It. Now, The Topic Of Time Dilation Will Be Explained.</p>

<h3><strong>Time Dilation : A New Journey</strong></h3>
<p>Time Dilation Means When Time Is Slowed Down Near An Blackhole And It Flows Slower Than Usual</p>
<p>If Something Can Slowed It Has An Speed Cause Something Can Only Be Slowed If It Has An Speed In General</p>

<h3><strong>The Speed Of Time Final Answer:</strong></h3>
<ul>
    <li>According To The Theory Of Relativity, Light’s Speed Is The Maximum In Our Universe: 3 × 10⁸ m/s.</li>
    <li>Pretty Fast, Right? Well, It Certainly Is!</li>
    <li>In Modern Physics, Time Doesn’t Have A Speed, But In My Version <em>It Does</em>.</li>
    <li>We Can Take The Speed Of Light As The Approximate Speed Of Time For Now.</li>
</ul>
